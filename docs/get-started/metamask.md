# MetaMask

In order to bet BNB on Token Race, you need to install MetaMask -- the browser-based blockchain wallet. 

## 1 - Install MetaMask

1. [Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) for your chosen browser. 
2. Follow the instructions to create your first wallet. Make sure to save the key in a safe & secure place!

## 2 - Add the Binance Smart Chain Network

MetaMask defaults to using the Ethereum blockchain, so we have to add the Binance Smart Chain blockchain.

1. **Click the MetaMask icon** in your extensions bar to open it
2. Click the round button at the top that says 'Ethereum Mainnet'

4. Enter these values

- Network Name: **Binance Smart Chain**
- New RPC URL: **https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/**
- ChainID: **56**
- Symbol: **BNB**
- Block Explorer URL: **https://bscscan.com**

5. Click **'Save'**

## 3 - Send BNB to your wallet

Now that your wallet is set up, you need some BNB to play with! 
1. **Buy BNB** on your preferred exchange
2. **Send it to your wallet address** using the Binance Smart Chain network (NOT Ethereum)

**Note:** If you already have BNB on the Ethereum blockchain, or your exchange doesn't support withdrawing using the Binance Smart Chain, you can use the [Binance Bridge](https://www.binance.org/en/bridge) to move it over. 

## 4 - Deposit BNB into Token Race
The final step is to deposit BNB into your Token Race account so you can use it for betting.
1. **Click the 'Connect Wallet' button** in the top-right of the Token Race website
2. Make sure the Binance Smart Chain network is selected, as well as the wallet that contains your BNB
3. **Click the 'Deposit' button** in the resulting modal and select how much BNB you want to be able to wager with.
